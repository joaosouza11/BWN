This site was created for training, using a fictitious company as a model.

It was used mostly HTML5 and CSS3, however it contains some JavaScript for the mobile menu and PHP for the contact form.

Part of the project structure was inspired by videos from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/EasyTutorialsVideo" target="_blank">"Easy Tutorials"</a> channel and knowledge that I acquired through the courses of the<a href="cursoemvideo.com" target="_blank">"Curso em VÃ­deo"</a>.
